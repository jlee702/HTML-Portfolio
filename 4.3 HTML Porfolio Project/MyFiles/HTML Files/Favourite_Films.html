<h1>My Favourite Movie/Show List</h1>
<h2>as of 2023</h2>
<h3>By Joel Lee</h3>

<hr />

<h2>Film 1: </h2>
<h3>Cyberpunk: Edge Runners</h3>
<p>A very solid animation that is held in the Cyberpunk world</p>
<p>A little dark, and has a very good ending :)</p>

<h2>Film 2: </h2>
<h3>The Harry Potter Series</h3>
<p>All of the movies are very nostalgic and always fun to rewatch after a few years</p>
<p>The first 3 are a little childish, but it definitely picks up in the latter half</p>

<h2>Film 3:</h2>
<h3>Studio Ghibli Movies</h3>
<p>I love the earlier ones: Spirited Away, Castle in the Sky, Ponyo, Princess Monomoke etc.</p>
<p>Always a classic and very entertaining to watch.</p>
